# The ultimate retirement model
## Retirement model that calculates your yearly required payment for a desired retirement annuity

### The model has two types of systemic withdrawal plans:
1. Capital Retention Systemic Withdrawal Plan (CRSWP):
* The goal in a capital retention systematic withdrawal plan is to have fixed payment rates but with the full intention of retaining capital. Typically, these plans will take a fund-of-funds approach, providing the necessary asset diversification. 
2. Capital Depletion Systemic Withdrawal Plan (CDSWP):
* In this form of plan, the intention is to allow the plan to pay out both principal and accrued income and capital gains by a predetermined date. In concept it is similar to owning a mortgage with a fixed term. The cash flow from the mortgage is a combination of interest and return of capital until the end of the term of the mortgage. In the case of these types of plans, the income is not predetermined like it would be in a mortgage, but is dependent on the underlying investments.

### The model also:
1. Adjusts cashflows and capital to expected inflation rate
2. Discounts capital to a desired discount rate.
